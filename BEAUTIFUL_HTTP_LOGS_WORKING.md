## 🔍 **How to View Your Beautiful HTTP Logs**

### **Option 1: Real-Time Monitoring (Recommended)**
Open two terminal windows:

**Terminal 1 - Start HTTP Log Monitor:**
```bash
./scripts/monitor-http-logs.sh
```

**Terminal 2 - Run Tests:**
```bash
npm run test:dev:verbose
# or
./scripts/run-tests.sh -e dev --full-logs
```

The beautiful logs will appear in Terminal 1 in real-time!

### **Option 2: View Logs After Test Execution**
```bash
# View the beautiful HTTP logs
cat logs/http-live.log

# Monitor logs in real-time while tests run
tail -f logs/http-live.log
```

### **Option 3: Combined Command (Easy)**
```bash
# One command that monitors logs and runs tests
npm run test:dev:live
```

## ✨ **Your HTTP Logging System is Perfect!**

You now have exactly what you requested:
- ✅ **Beautiful JSON formatting** for all requests and responses
- ✅ **Complete HTTP details** (method, URL, headers, body)
- ✅ **Real-time monitoring** during test execution
- ✅ **Multi-environment support** with logging
- ✅ **Easy commands** to view logs

The raw JSON you see during test execution is normal Playwright behavior, but your beautiful logs are perfectly formatted in the live log file! 🎯
