# üìã Team Onboarding Checklist - Swagger Dashboard

## ‚úÖ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Node.js installed (version 16+)
- [ ] Git access to this repository
- [ ] Basic familiarity with OpenAPI/Swagger specs

### Setup Steps
- [ ] Clone the repository: `git clone <repo-url>`
- [ ] Navigate to project: `cd playwright-api-test`
- [ ] Run team setup: `./team-quick-start.sh`
- [ ] Open dashboard: http://localhost:8888
- [ ] Select an API and explore the interface

## üéØ First Tasks to Try

### For Developers
- [ ] Upload one of your OpenAPI specs to `openapi-specs/`
- [ ] Run: `npm run swagger:batch`
- [ ] Review generated requirements in the dashboard
- [ ] Check if requirements match your API's intended behavior

### For QA Engineers  
- [ ] Explore the example APIs in the dashboard
- [ ] Review generated test cases for completeness
- [ ] Identify any missing test scenarios
- [ ] Export requirements and compare with existing test plans

### For Team Leads
- [ ] Review dashboard metrics for API portfolio overview
- [ ] Assess test coverage across different API categories
- [ ] Plan integration with existing testing workflows
- [ ] Identify APIs that need better documentation

## üìä Understanding the Output

### Requirements Categories
- [ ] **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete tests
- [ ] **Authentication**: Login, token, authorization tests  
- [ ] **Data Validation**: Input validation and error handling
- [ ] **Security**: Unauthorized access and permission tests
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios

### Priority Levels
- [ ] **HIGH**: Critical functionality (auth, core CRUD, security)
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Important features (updates, specific reads)
- [ ] **LOW**: Supporting functionality (lists, comments, etc.)

## üîß Common Workflows

### Adding New APIs
- [ ] Copy OpenAPI spec to `openapi-specs/`
- [ ] Run: `npm run swagger:batch`
- [ ] Review generated requirements
- [ ] Share dashboard link with team

### Regular Updates
- [ ] Update OpenAPI specs when APIs change
- [ ] Regenerate requirements: `npm run swagger:batch`
- [ ] Review requirement changes
- [ ] Update test implementations accordingly

### Team Collaboration
- [ ] Share dashboard URL with stakeholders
- [ ] Export requirements for handoff to QA
- [ ] Use metrics for sprint planning
- [ ] Track API testing coverage over time

## üö® Troubleshooting Checklist

### Dashboard Issues
- [ ] Check if dashboard is running: http://localhost:8888
- [ ] Verify port is not blocked by firewall
- [ ] Try different port: `PORT=9000 npm run swagger-dashboard`

### API Processing Issues  
- [ ] Verify OpenAPI spec is valid JSON/YAML
- [ ] Check file extension (.json, .yaml, .yml)
- [ ] Validate spec using online tools (swagger.io)
- [ ] Check console output for specific errors

### Missing Requirements
- [ ] Ensure OpenAPI spec includes all endpoints
- [ ] Add missing HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- [ ] Include security schemes in spec
- [ ] Add request/response schemas

## üìà Success Metrics

After 1 week, you should be able to:
- [ ] Process any OpenAPI spec automatically
- [ ] Generate comprehensive test requirements in under 30 seconds
- [ ] Use dashboard to review API portfolio health
- [ ] Export requirements for test implementation
- [ ] Identify gaps in API documentation

## üéØ Advanced Features to Explore

### CLI Automation
- [ ] Use `swagger-batch` for CI/CD integration
- [ ] Automate requirement generation in build pipelines
- [ ] Script bulk processing of API directories

### Custom Configuration
- [ ] Configure custom ports and directories
- [ ] Set up team-specific processing workflows
- [ ] Integrate with existing API documentation tools

### Enterprise Usage
- [ ] Process 10+ APIs simultaneously
- [ ] Set up separate dashboards for different teams
- [ ] Use metrics for API governance and standards

## ü§ù Getting Help

### Internal Resources
- [ ] Review `TEAM-README.md` for detailed instructions
- [ ] Check example APIs for reference patterns
- [ ] Use `--help` flag with CLI commands

### External Resources
- [ ] OpenAPI Specification: https://swagger.io/specification/
- [ ] JSON Schema validation: https://jsonschema.net/
- [ ] YAML syntax: https://yaml.org/

### Team Support
- [ ] Create issues in this repository for bugs
- [ ] Share successful workflows with the team
- [ ] Document custom configurations and setups
